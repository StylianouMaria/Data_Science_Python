#Data Visualisation with Python - I

#DATA WRANGLING: Process of identify, collect, merge and preprocess
#one or more datasets in preparation for data cleaning

#DATA CLEANING: fixng errors, dealing with missing data, correct formatting
#fixing and removing incorrect data

#DATA PREPARATION: normalisation for machine learning, understanidng 
#visualisation is essential for the above techniques

#DATA VISUALISATION:
#Bar chart or comumn chart: 
'''
• Discrete data: data that can be counted
• Compares values across categories
• Best for categorical data (few categories)
• Colour coded categories for patterns to stand out
'''

#Line graph: 
'''
• Shows values over time
• Multiple values can be shown from different categories
• Best for linear/continuous data, time series data
• Lines can be colour coded
• Time if often the x-axis
'''

#Pie Chart:
'''
• Represents the proportion of the quantity
• Sum is 100%, Have no more than 10 segments
• easy to separate categories
'''

#Pyramid chart:
'''
• Hierarchical visualisation, shows the relationships through the stacks
• Best for different sub-categories and works non-specific numerical values 
'''


#Notes:
'''
1. Clean and preprocess data before visualisation.
2. Lear about the datam to plan the visualisation techniques
3. Determine the goals of the projects, what u are trying to find
- Sometimes this is not known at the beginning of the analysis
4. Data visualisation: What type of data you are using?
5. Refine the visualisation: make them more aesthetic pleasing and understandable
6. Write down the findings and observation/ questions, original goals
